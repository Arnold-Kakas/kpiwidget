**kpiwidget** is an interactive HTML widget for R that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) in Quarto dashboards. This package was inspired by the [summarywidget](https://github.com/kent37/summarywidget) package and enhances its functionality by providing additional KPIs (referred to as "statistics" in summarywidget).

> **Note:** This widget is designed to work only with `crosstalk::SharedData` objects.

## Features

- **Enhanced KPI Support:**  
  kpiwidget offers wider range of KPIs ("count", "distinctCount", "duplicates", "sum", "mean", "min", "max") as well as comparison modes ("ratio" and "share") that let you compare groups within your data.
  Ratio and share are mathematically very similar (one is essentially the other scaled by 100) but they can convey different meanings. 
  A "ratio" is expressed as a multiplier (for example, 0.75 or 1.25) while "share" is expressed as a percentage (75% or 125%), which many find more intuitive when thinking in terms of proportions or parts of a whole. 
  In reporting, one might prefer a ratio when comparing factors directly and a share when emphasizing what portion one group represents of another. 

- **Crosstalk Integration:**  
  Designed to work exclusively with `crosstalk::SharedData` objects, kpiwidget enables seamless interactive filtering and linking with other widgets on your Quarto dashboard.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **kpiwidget** from GitHub using:

```{r}
# Install devtools if you don't have it
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Arnold-Kakas/kpiwidget")
```

## Usage

Before using `kpiwidget`, ensure your data is wrapped in a `crosstalk::SharedData()` object:

```{r}
# load libraries
library(crosstalk)
library(kpiwidget)

# Wrap a data.frame in SharedData:
sd <- SharedData$new(mtcars)

# Display the mean mpg of cars with 4 cylinders.
kpiwidget(sd, 
          kpi = "mean", 
          column = "mpg",
          selection = ~ cyl == 4
          )
```
